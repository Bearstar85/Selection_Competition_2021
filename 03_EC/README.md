# INPUT

Note that this graph and data is not included in the current MS form. 

The input data here is from **02_DRC** directory. A merged file (all metals **ECvalues.csv** output files merged and manually indexed)
**ECvaluesAll_MStall.csv** contains each strains predicted EC0.05, EC0.50,
and EC0.95, as well as metadata for making figures. Eight strains from
Gropviken (4 T. baltica and 4 S. marinoi) and 4 metals (Ag, Cd, Cu, and
Zn). These strains are the same as is mixed in the
downstream Competition experiment. *SM_GP2-4_16* and *SM_GP2-4_6** are
aliases for the same strain (my crappy handwriting caused this)

I have manually changed *SM_GP2-4_16* to *SM_GP2-4_06*, and *TB_GP2-4_9* to
*TB_GP2-4_09* in the input data here for the graph.

# SCRIPT
